# ankusha

Is a HA PostgreSQL agent.

This is how it could be:

```
ankusha new cluster --config cluster.edn
> master node running on X.X.X.X:8650

curl localhost:8650/status
> master | X.X.X.X:8650

ankusha new node --join X.X.X.X:8650
> take base backup
> setup streaming replication
> replica node running on X.X.X.Y:8650


curl localhost:8650/status
> master  | X.X.X.X:8650
> replica | X.X.X.Y:8650


ankusha new node --join X.X.X.X:8650, X.X.X.Y:8650
> take base backup
> setup streaming replication
> replica node running on X.X.X.Z:8650

curl localhost:8650/status
> master  | X.X.X.X:8650
> replica | X.X.X.Y:8650
> replica | X.X.X.Z:8650


#stop master

curl localhost:8650/status
> master  | X.X.X.Y:8650
> replica | X.X.X.Z:8650

curl localhost:8650/log
> ts: master was moved to X.X.X.Y

ankusha basebackup create
ankusha backup create
ankusha schedule backup 'every day'
ankusha schedule switchover 'every week'

```

## Design ideas

* anku is agent running on every node
* anku supervises postgresql backend
* anku manages configuration of postgresql, streaming replication and log shipping
* anku agents are in consensus cluster providing automatic failover
* anku has REST API as primary interface to manage/discover cluster 
* anku cloud aware (especially aws)
* anku could be packed as docker image
